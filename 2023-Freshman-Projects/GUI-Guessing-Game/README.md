# GUI Number Guessing Game (2023)

**Course:** Computational Thinking (Freshman Year)  
**Tech Stack:** `Python` , `Tkinter` , `Random` , `Time`

---

### Description
A logic-based interactive application that utilizes a graphical user interface to challenge users' deductive reasoning. This project served as a foundational exploration into building responsive desktop applications and managing real-time program states.   

---

### Key Technical Implementations
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Engineered a responsive UI that handles asynchronous user inputs and button-click events via the `Tkinter` main loop.
* **Dynamic State Management:** Implemented real-time tracking of player scores, attempt counters, and timing logic to calculate performance metrics.
* **Robust Input Validation:** Developed a backend validation layer to ensure user entries are sanitized (integers only) and remain within predefined logical bounds.
* **Randomization Algorithms:** Leveraged the `random` library to generate unpredictable targets, ensuring unique session generation.
